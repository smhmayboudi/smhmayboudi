I am a passionate senior software engineer with a strong background in microservice architecture and containerization, particularly using the Go programming language (GoLang) and TypeScript. My expertise includes implementing the twelve factors of apps, focusing on code guidelines, dependency management, configurability, service design, automation, integration management, containerization standards, testing, process engineering, error handling, and log tracing. I adhere to clean architecture principles and prioritize modularity, maintainability, and SOLID principles, following Agile SDLC methodology.

As a leader, I excel in driving high-performing teams through effective communication and clarity. I coordinate the development of infrastructure and code, project management, and meeting the project's requirements. I empower team members to take responsibility and align their actions with the project's visions and missions. To optimize self-awareness, I deploy tracking software.

My development approach emphasizes automation using git hooks, coding conventions, documentation, code generation, conventional commit messages, lint-ing, formatting, testing, vulnerability checking, static and dynamic code analysis, and container security best practices. I prioritize reconfigurability and provisioning of services and conduct thorough code reviews. My preferred development, running, and testing environment is docker-compose, ensuring the health check of each service.

To maintain project timelines, I carefully manage the number and timing of meetings and define issue labels and statuses. My meticulous approach ensures long-term project success.

Overall, I bring a wealth of technical expertise and leadership skills to my role as a senior software engineer, combining a focus on cutting-edge technologies with effective project management and team coordination.
